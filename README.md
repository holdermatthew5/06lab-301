## Getting Started

To bring this app to your own device, start by visiting https://github.com/holdermatthew5/06lab-301.git and forking the repository.

From there you can copy the link from the browsers search bar and run the following code in your command line pasting the url in place of 'url':
  - `git clone url`

You'll then need to create an account with all the necessary APIs. When you do you'll be assigned an API key for each API. This key is individual to you and can result in a charge if overused, so be sure to add it to your .env file and add your .env file to your .gitignore file. This will ensure your keys are not sent to heroku or github so they're not used by unauthorized users.

Each API will also have a link. This link is needed to access the API and should replace the string parts of the respective url variables (do not replace urls in constructors). You will also need to change the keys in the queryParams (server.js:161) object to match the terms that would be used in the APIs documentation.

Once you've collected your APIs you'll need to create the .env file mentioned above in the same level as your server.js file and type the following code with no spaces or punctuation into the file (this is case sensitive, make sure to account for the example keys and search queries in the link):
  - `PORT=3000`.
  - `GEOCODE_API_KEY=your-key`.
  - `WEATHER_API_KEY=your-key`.
  - `HIKING_API_KEY=your-key`.
  - `DATABASE_URL=postgres://your-user-name:your-pass-word@localhost:5432/your-database-name`.

To create your database run the following command in your sql command line:
  - `CREATE DATABASE name-of-database`.

Then, if you created a database with a name other than 'cityexplorer' look for every instance of the string cityexplorer in your schema.sql file and server.js file.

To deploy:
- To deploy to github:
  - Find your forked repo.
  - Find the settings page.
  - Find 'Source' in the 'GitHub Pages' section.
  - Open the drop down list and select master or main (whichever appears to you).
  - Finally click save and scroll back down to find the link to your app in the same place.

- To deploy with heroku:
  - From your command line, run `heroku create` then `git push heroku master`.
  - Then to find the link to your deployed app run `git remote -v` in the command line while in the root level of the repository.
  - Once done you can copy your database to your heroku version with the following command:
    - `heroku pg:psql -f path/to/schema.sql --app your-app-name`.
  - From the settings page of your app (on heroku) find the config vars section and click 'Reveal Config Vars'. This will show a hidden area on screen where you can enter your API keys. The names of these keys should perfectly match the way they are referenced in your code.
